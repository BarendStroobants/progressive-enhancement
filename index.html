        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said, <q class="commiserate">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run
                away.This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong></q> The
            next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
            said, <q class="commiserate">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
                horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe</strong></q>.</p>

        <p>following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="commiserate">Oh dear, that’s too
                <strong class="bad">bad</strong>
            </q>, and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> The next day the
            conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because
            he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="commiserate">Isn’t that
                great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p>

        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell whether anything that happens in it is
            <strong class="good">good</strong>
            or
            <strong class="bad">bad</strong>
        — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
        consequences of
        <strong class="good">good</strong>
        fortune.</p>

        <p>Conclusion
            <tag fortune="good">good</tag>
            and
            <tag fortune="bad>" bad
        </p>
        are just one perspective. Bananas are
        <tag fortune="good">good</tag>
        for monkeys, but monkeys are not
        <tag fortune="good">good</tag>
        for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
